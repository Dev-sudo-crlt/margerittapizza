Step 1
For the pizza bases, sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in yeast, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Make a well in the centre and add 200ml warm water with the oil. Bring together with a wooden spoon or your hands, then turn out dough onto a floured surface. Knead for 5 minutes by hand (or in an electric mixer with a dough hook) until the dough is smooth.
Step 2
Lightly grease the cleaned bowl with a little oil, then add dough and cover with a tea towel. Set aside in a warm place to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
Step 3
Preheat oven to 240Â°C. Knock back the dough by punching it to remove air and divide into 2 balls. Roll dough out on a floured surface until you have 2 very thin, 25cm-diameter pizza bases. Carefully transfer to 2 lightly floured baking sheets.
Step 4
Combine passata or sugo with basil and garlic, then spread over pizza bases leaving a 2cm border. Divide the bocconcini between bases, then scatter with parmesan and cherry tomatoes (cutside up). Drizzle with olive oil and bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese has melted and the pizza bases are crisp and lightly golden around the edges.
Step 5
Drizzle the pizzas with a little more olive oil, garnish with small basil leaves then serve immediately.
